This mod makes so you can man all selected mortars with one click, no more manually clicking pawns to man 20 mortars!

Additionaly, it also adds an "Attack Area" button, where you can select an area to spread the impact zone of all the mortars. this was done with intention to be used with the Toxic Shells, so the gas can spread in a bigger area.
